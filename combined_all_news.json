Unlike competitors like Ford and Stellantis, GM's strategy focuses on cost control and fading temporary pressures rather than relying on strong industry growth or price hikes.",

    "content": "After a three-week rally, Baker Hughes' \n   reports the number of active U.S. oil and gas rigs is down, falling to 421 this week, an decrease of 3 rigs over last week. \nU.S. oil rigs down significantly by 7 to 330 from 337 last week, while U.S. natural gas rigs were up 4 to 90 versus 86 last week and miscellaneous rigs came in the same at 1. \nThe U.S. offshore rig count remained stable once again this week at 21, but is down 7 rigs year over year. \nWhile the recent increase of U.S. active rigs had been somewhat expected at this stage in the cycle and a fairly positive event in recent weeks, following U.S. and global crude oil's reaction to the United Kingdom's break from the European Union, the market could have been further stressed by the count's continued ascent. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. benchmark, were down 4.7% to $47.77 at 1 p.m., while the global Brent crude benchmark saw futures down 4.6% to $48.54. \nIn short, rigs being put back to work earlier than many analysts expected could signal operators are working their way through drilled but uncompleted wells, or DUCs, which therefore entails that U.S. production could see less of a decline than anticipated.   \nThe International Energy Agency has hinted toward this outcome in recent weeks, leading many, including longtime oil market bear Goldman Sachs, to believe the commodity recovery remains in a fragile state. Prior to a commodity rally beginning in March, industry followers saw little hope for rigs going back to work in 2016, and even after prices seemed to stabilize near $50 per barrel, bullish analysts have only pulled up forecasts to the tail-end of 2016. \nBut according to TheStreet's founder Jim Cramer, and as BHI's report demonstrated Friday, data that we're getting about oil continues to show a decline in the amount of drilling, leading him to believe oil remains between $45 and $50 per barrel, despite recent breakouts from powerhouses ExxonMobil \n    and Chevron \n   , which suggest oil is heading toward $80.  \n\"I don't think [oil] is doing that,\" Cramer explained, adding that recent positive movement of oil stocks like Pioneer Natural Resources \n    despite oil's fall illustrates the lack of opportunities for buying oil stocks now. \"I don't see any bargains in oil.\" \nA sooner-than-expected uptick in U.S. drilling, which has fallen dramatically as companies drastically cut capital expenditures through 2015 and into the first quarter of 2016 when oil prices hit a 12-year low, could halt improvement in a global oversupply of oil that has been dampened in recent months with exogenous production disruptions in Canada, Nigeria and elsewhere.  \nAnd while many analysts, such as the KLR Group's Darren Gacicia, insist that the supply-demand imbalance is headed toward correcting itself, others, including Cantor Fitzgerald's Brad Carpenter have opined that U.S. producers' insistence on adding rigs in a $50 oil world could prove self-defeating and cause a delay in a West Texas Intermediate crude oil rally that at one point did not see oil above that mark until 2018.  \nNevertheless, the market could feel some relief Friday after seeing the U.S. lose the majority of what it gained last week in oil rigs, an event that signals continue volatility in the count and shines light on the looming theory that $50 may not be the magic number. \n                        Click to view a price quote on XOM.\n                        Click to research the Energy  industry.",

    "content": "As you seek safe-haven stocks in the aftermath of the Brexit meltdown, consider the tech giants,  \nFacebook  \n and Google parent \nAlphabet \n  . They have the size and high-demand services to withstand downturns. \nTo be sure, both companies suffered with the rest of the market Monday. \nBut Facebook and Google should provide growth opportunities -- perhaps a 30% upside. Both companies have expanded their offerings. Facebook is projecting strong growth for the next five years. Alphabet can boast of high profit margins.  \nThese stocks should be on your radar as \"defensive growth\" plays with considerable upside. \n  \nFacebook is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. See how Cramer rates the stock here. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells FB? Learn more now. \nFacebook \nFacebook has beaten earnings expectations for the last four quarters. \nMoreover, Facebook has expanded its portfolio of businesses with WhatsApp, Instagram, videos, news consumption and virtual reality platforms. \nThe company is projecting 34% per year earnings per share (EPS) growth for the next half a decade. \nTrading at a PEG ratio of 0.91, Facebook shares are among the cheapest for a large tech stock. The company has 1.6 billion active users, and more importantly a growing ad business. It is also expanding its businesses in video and virtual reality. \nThe 44 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Facebook have a median target of $145, pointing to the nearly 30% price appreciation potential from current levels. \nInvestors who avoided Facebook because of the high stock price can now take advantage of the recent weakness. \nTo be sure, the stock pays no dividends because it's on a growth curve. But its annual free cash flow is becoming stronger with each passing year. \nChurning out billions in rising FCF, Facebook is exactly where Apple was a decade ago. Facebook is a growth stock winner in what is likely to be a tough year for markets. \n \n  \nAlphabet \nAlphabet shares are down 11% in 2016. The lower price offers an opportunity, though. \nThe company offers mid-teen earnings growth. It has an upside potential in excess of 30% over the next year. Alphabet's ad/search business is a major cash cow.  \nALPHABET is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. See how Cramer rates the stock here. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells GOOG? Learn more now. \nMoreover, Alphabet is multi-faceted, including not only its popular search engine, but also ads, maps, apps, YouTube and Android and the related technical infrastructure. \nThe company has been innovative, as well. It offers Google Fiber, which is likely to be a strong competitor to AT&T, Promoted Pins, Self-Driving Cars/Vans, Google Assistant and Google Home and a possible online TV service. While its Moonshot factory arguably hasn't done as well, that tiny business is a relatively small part of the overall landscape. \nBut its strategy of adding other parts is a long-term growth positive. \nThe company's massive cash war-chest, coupled with minimal debt, also makes Alphabet among the safest companies around. Its nearly 22% profit margin, high return ratios and projected revenue growth are other positives. \nAt a PEG ratio of 1.23, Alphabet is Brexit-proof. Accumulate the stock at every dip and set yourself up for major gains. \n--- \nPost-Brexit anxiety is pummeling global markets. If you'd rather avoid stocks and bonds altogether during this period of extraordinary volatility, I know a way you can make a guaranteed $67,548 over the next 12 months. In fact, this moneymaking technique is so successful and simple, you might want to give up \"conventional\" investing forever!

This disparity suggests investors might be overlooking the company's inferior earnings outlook, potentially leaving them vulnerable to future disappointment if the P/E ratio adjusts to align with growth expectations.",

However, this high ROE is largely due to the company's substantial debt-to-equity ratio of 6.60, indicating that while returns are strong, they are heavily financed by debt. Investors should consider both the high ROE and the associated leverage when evaluating the company's financial performance.",

If so, here are Jim Cramer's top takeaways for today's trading. \n \nTwilio \n  : In his \"Know Your IPO\" segment, Cramer took a look at Twilio, the cloud communications company that came public last Thursday at $15 a share only to rocket 94% to $29 by the close of its first day and another 3% today. \nCramer explained that Twilio allows companies including Uber, Nordstrom \n  and Facebook's \n  What's App to add real-time communications services to their applications. The company offers everything from voice messaging, call recording, text messages and even embedded video services for developers of all sizes. \nTwilio boasts 28,000 active customers and charges fees based on customers' usage, meaning that as Uber and Facebook expand their user bases, Twilio shares in the profits. That's how the company saw 78% revenue growth in 2014 and accelerated that to 88% in 2015. \nTwilio is not without some risk factors, however. The company is not profitable and is playing in an unproven market. Twilio also derives 15% of its revenue from a single customer, Facebook, which could decided to built its own platforms. \nThen there's Twilio's valuation. The stock now trades at 13 times sales, or factoring in its growth rate, 7.5 times 2016 sales. That's higher than the current valuation of Salesforce.com \n  . \nBut valuation aside, Cramer said he thinks Twilio is a winner on any weakness. \n \n   \nIdexx Labs \n  : In an exclusive interview, Cramer sat down with Jonathan Ayers, chairman and CEO of Idexx Labs, an animal health products and services company. \nAyers said when it comes to our pets and their care, the sky's the limit. That's how a company like Idexx can still see 5% organic growth in times of recession, as the company did in 2009. Pets are not just an American phenomenon. Ayers noted that Idexx sees Europe still as an emerging market for the company, while other countries, like Brazil, have 75 million pets and almost no veterinary care. \nAyers went on to explain that Idexx' new urine analyzer for cats can give pets a voice and tell vets what's wrong in just three minutes, and is more accurate than traditional testing. Since testing is done on a continual basis, Idexx enjoys lots of recurring revenue. \nCramer concluded that Idexx is the type of stock you buy when Brexit takes the entire stock market lower. \nTo read a full recap of \"Mad Money\" on CNBC, click here. \nTo watch replays of Cramer's video segments, visit the Mad Money page on CNBC. \nTo sign up for Jim Cramer's free Booyah! newsletter with all of his latest articles and videos please click here.\n                        Click to view a price quote on TWLO.",

While adjusted gross profits decreased, the adjusted operating margin improved, and the company generated strong cash flow from operations, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.",

This positive outlook follows a recent earnings beat where the company reported $0.44 EPS against an expected $0.38, and revenue of $1.19 billion. Despite the beat and raised guidance, the stock's market reaction was muted due to GAAP weakness and one-time charges, with analysts maintaining a \"Moderate Buy\" rating and an average target price of $82.73.",

The company, which also develops well-known titles Red Dead Redemption, NBA 2K, Civilization and WWE 2K, ended fiscal 2016 with its third consecutive year of stronger-than-expected sales and profit. \nSales for the year-ended March 31 fell 6.4% to $1.56 billion, as last year benefited from a more extensive title release slate such as the launch of Grand Theft Auto V on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. But sales outperformed the company's original outlook of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Earnings for the year tallied $1.96 a share compared to an outlook of 75 cents to $1.00 a share offered at the start of the fiscal year. \nSales in the fourth quarter clocked in at $342.5 million compared to guidance for $260 million to $310 million due primarily to stronger than expected results from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. NBA 2K16 also exceeded Take-Two's sales expectations. \nThe better-than-anticipated performance in what remains a crowded videogame space -- made no easier by the competition for consumer eyeballs with Netflix \n  -- has led investors to snatch up Take-Two's stock. Shares have surged 30% over the past year, outperforming the Nasdaq Composite's 4.3% decline. \nWith another solid year under its belt, attention has turned to when Take-Two will unveil Grand Theft Auto 6 to capitalize on GTA 5's success in selling over 65 million copies since its launch a couple years ago. So far, Take-Two has not issued a release date, instead focusing on continuing to upgrade the gameplay for GTA 5 in order to keep consumers hooked. \nBut, seeing as GTA 5 has been on the market for over two and a half years, it's only natural to wonder what's taking Take-Two so long to launch the next iteration in the popular franchise. \n\"We aim for perfection and that takes time,\" Take-Two Interactive chairman and CEO Strauss Zelnick told TheStreet, adding, \"By resting our core products and not being on an annualized schedule we build anticipation.\" Zelnick pointed out that frequent new content releases for a title like Grand Theft Auto keeps people engaged and drives recurring consumer spending. \nMeanwhile, it's also natural to wonder if Take-Two's solid performance and bulging cash balance has caught the attention of fellow publishers who may want to bulk up via an acquisition. Take-Two is no stranger to being courted. Rival Electronic Arts \n  made a hostile $2 billion bid for Take Two back in 2008, which was early on in Zelnick's leadership of the company. Now, Electronic Arts appears to be on the acquisition hunt again, and its CEO hasn't ruled out making a play for Take-Two. \n\"For the last three years, we have been very focused on our company and getting it right in terms of culture and reinvigorating the company,\" Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson told TheStreet in a recent interview when asked about revisiting Take-Two. Wilson, who was at Electronic Arts when it went hostile for Take-Two, added, \"We are now at a place where we think we are in a really good position, and so we are open to acquisitions for the first time I would say in the last few years.\" \nZelnick didn't completely kill the notion of sitting down with Electronic Arts, either. \"We like being independent, and equally we are here for the shareholders -- I think we are really proud of the track record of building value for our shareholders, the stock just hit an all-time high,' said Zelnick. \nIn the meantime, Take-Two will look to capitalize on pre-holiday launches such as Mafia III, NBA 2K17, WWE 2K17 and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. ity.\n                        Click to view a price quote on TTWO.\n                        Click to research the Computer Software &  Services  industry.",

    "content": "Aehr Test Systems' stock declined due to market concerns over Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) sales guidance, which suggested a sequential decline despite significant year-over-year growth. The market perceived this as a potential slowdown in AI infrastructure spending, impacting Aehr Test Systems which is shifting towards AI processor testing. However, a day earlier, Teradyne, another semiconductor test equipment company, reported strong results fueled by AI demand, suggesting that the market's reaction to AMD might be an overcorrection and a potential buying opportunity for Aehr Test Systems as its business follows these earlier cycles.",

Despite the NAST segment's strong performance, the company's overall Q4 revenue and operating income saw declines due to the sale of its Europe surface transportation business and lower pricing in other sectors.",

The number of cars with the airbag inflator defects totals over 743,000 units, while those with emission control defects total approximately 1.55 million, according to the automaker's disclosure. Other reports have suggested higher figures. \nThe glitches were found for cars manufactured between 2009 and 2015. The automaker will start the recalls from Thursday. \nToyota's recall adds to a series of similar actions taken by its counterparts in recent months. Mitsubishi Motors  \n  in February recalled vehicles with improperly installed right-turn indicator switches, while in April, Nissan Motor \n  recalled cars installed with air bags with risks of not deploying. Worldwide, automakers including Ford \n  , BMW \n  , and General Motors  \n  that adopt defective airbags manufactured by Takata have also been forced to make recalls over the last two years. \nOn Wednesday, Toyota also said that its global output, including those for separately listed subsidiaries Daihatsu  \n   and Hino \n   , advanced 11.1% year-on -year. Toyota on its own enjoyed growth for the first time in two months for its domestic production and for a third consecutive month overseas. \nDaihatsu shareholders on Wednesday approved a bid from Toyota for the outstanding 49.8% stake despite some dissent about the valuation. Toyota in January said it would offer 0.26 of a share per Diahatsu share, or about Y399 billion ($3.9 billion) at the time for the outstanding shares. The takeover is due to close on Aug. 1. \nShares in Toyota closed up 2.9% in Tokyo. The automaker, which has a large operational base in the U.K., has lost nearly 11% since the close of June 23, the day the country's voters chose to leave the European Union. The company has reportedly warned it employees that a Brexit would cause major risks for its U.K. business.\n                        Click to view a price quote on TM.\n                        Click to research the Automotive  industry.",

While an intermediate-term peak is suggested, which could lead to testing support levels of $103.65 and $97.99, the firm also sees pending weakness as an attractive longer-term entry point. Meanwhile, Newmont faces reduced gold output due to bushfire damage and is decreasing its stake in Fuerte Metals, though Raymond James recently raised its price target for NEM to $111 with an Outperform rating.",

    "content": "Just as the oil and gas industry started to see signs of renewed life in the U.S., the United Kingdom appears to have sent a title wave crashing down on commodity markets. \nWest Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were down more than 5% to $47.56 as the stock markets prepared to open Friday. Futures for the global benchmark, Brent Crude, were down nearly 5.4% to $48.18.  \nU.S. stock markets also saw their steepest decline in 10 months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by 400 points to start the day, the S&P 500 opened down 37 points, and the Nasdaq Composite took its largest daily hit since 2011, beginning the session down 186 points, or 3.8%. \nWhile the effect of the so-called Brexit weighing heavily across the board, diversified oil and gas behemoths like ExxonMobil \n    and Chevron \n    took a relatively modest hit in share prices, both down less than 2% near 10 a.m. Friday.  \nNot surprisingly, oil and gas players that are more heavily levered to commodity prices, such as U.S. independent explorers and producers QEP Resources \n   , Pioneer Natural Resources \n    and Marathon Oil \n   , were all suffering greater losses between 3% and 4% early Friday.  \nThe drop in oil prices following Brexit can be largely linked to a bolstered dollar, which saw as much as a 3.7% increase Friday, as a stronger dollar typically depresses oil prices.  \nBut fear not says BMI Research, a market analysis firm, in the long-term the UK's Brexit vote will have a limited impact on the global crude oil market. \n\"Risk-off trading will depress prices in the coming days, but positive physical fundamentals - which remain unchanged in the wake of the vote - will see any losses quickly pared. However, we highlight strong downside risks to North Sea investments, due to renewed uncertainty surrounding Scottish independence,\" BMI analysts wrote in a Friday report. \"Heightened volatility and broad risk-off sentiment pose further downside risk to prices [temporarily]. However, declines will be capped by firming fundamentals in the physical crude oil market and we expect any losses to be rapidly reversed.\" \nOn the other hand, the firm also warns that the Brexit vote is \"a potential trigger for wider and more sustained financial market weakness\" and has raised the odds on other tail-risk events, such as a U.S. recession, Chinese yuan devaluation and a fiscal crisis in Japan.  \nMeanwhile, the commodities market could take another blow later today as Baker Hughes is set to release its weekly rig report at 1 p.m. \nAfter three consecutive weeks of reported rig increases, a fourth uptick in active rigs could mean operators are putting rigs back to work sooner than expected, and even though analysts have warned that production tends to lag increased rig activity significantly, some have noted that a lower-than-expected U.S. production decline could hinder a global oil rally. \n                        Click to view a price quote on XOM.\n                        Click to research the Energy  industry.",

    "content": "Updated with additional details. \nHershey's \n  business may be looking too sweet to for one fellow food giant to ignore. \nShares of the iconic chocolate maker were up 15% to $111.87 in afternoon trading Thursday following a report by The Wall Street Journal that fellow candy giant Mondelez  \n  has made a $23 billion bid in cash and stock, or $107 a share, for the company. Shares of Mondelez were trading up 4.8% to $45.05 on Thursday.  \nHershey confirmed the bid, but the company promptly rejected it, noting that its board determined that Mondelez's expression of interest provided no basis for further discussion. \nHershey's rebuff could mean it is trying to secure a higher bid from Mondelez. According to an afternoon note by analysts at Stifel, Mondelez could bid end up bidding $120 to $130 to seal the deal for Hershey. \nA Hershey spokeswoman did not immediately return a request for comment. \nAccording to the WSJ, any acquisition of Hershey would have to be approved by the Hershey Trust, which holds 81% of the voting rights of the stock and 8.3% of outstanding shares, though Mondelez is prepared to work to win the trust's approval. But, the Hershey Trust has set a precedent of being unpredictable.  \nIn 2002, the charitable trust that controls Hershey abandoned a $12.5 billion cash-and-stock offer from fellow candy-maker Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company in the final stages of approval.   \nWrigley's offer represented a generous 42% premium over Hershey's stock price at the time, and Hershey's auction also attracted a joint bid from Nestlé and Cadbury Schweppes. Wrigley went on to be acquired by Mars for $23 billion in 2008 in a deal that was financed by legendary investor Warren Buffett. And Cadbury was acquired by Kraft Foods, which split off its confectionery business into Mondelez in 2012. \nHere's a brief look at what may have attracted the maker of Chips Ahoy, Oreos and Cadbury, among many other well-known brands, to Hershey.  \n1. Hershey is reinventing its business. \nHershey recently acquired \"snacking chocolate\" brand Barkthins. TheStreet recently sampled several versions of Barkthins and can confidently report they are absurdly addicting and have a much better nutrition profile than a regular dark chocolate bar. Further, Barkthins have gobbled up some prime shelf space at major retailers such as Walmart \n  lately as they play into the broader consumer trend toward snacking. \nBarkthins joined another interesting acquisition made by Hershey of Krave beef jerky last year. Krave has some of the most innovative flavors in the premium beef jerky market, and similar to Barkthins is receiving prime shelf space at major retailers due to their snacking qualities. \nMondelez may appreciate the diversification beyond core chocolate bars.  \n2. Core Hershey products are being reinvented. \nWalk down most candy aisles today and you're likely to come across two new snack mixes from Hershey's -- the Reese's snack mix (peanut butter cups mixed with nuts in a 2-ounce package size), and the Hershey's snack mix (mini-Hershey bars mixed with pretzel and almonds in resealable plastic containers). These new products make ridiculous amounts of sense in this new snacking-crazed world. \nUltimately, it's good to see the creativity around a storied name such as Hershey, and likely has Mondelez optimistic on further innovations in the not-too-distant future. \n3., Cost-cutting continues. \nLike Coca-Cola  \n  , General Mills  \n   Kellogg  \n   and other big-name food companies, Hershey has not been reluctant to wield the ax to improve profit margins and the flow of new innovations. The company recently increased its annual savings target from cost-cutting to $100 million per year through 2019, from the previous $50 million to $70 million.  \nMondelez may have confidence that under its umbrella, it could slash even more costs at Hershey, by, for instance saving on raw materials such as sugar and fuel.\n                        Click to view a price quote on HSY.\n                        Click to research the Food & Beverage  industry.",

Investors are now focused on the company's ability to execute on project milestones and manage risks related to its pre-revenue status and lack of price supports, transforming its narrative towards national security rather than pure speculative mining.",

This move strengthens Qualcomm's architecture development for the next decade rather than signaling a shift to competing RISC-V products.",

The company's valuation story currently suggests it is undervalued with a fair value of $396.80 against a last close of $352.16, driven by expected future earnings strength from digital infrastructure investments. However, its P/E ratio of 42.2x is higher than the fair ratio of 33.8x and peer averages, indicating some optimism is already priced in.",

The third major contractor, General Dynamics  \n  , took a minor hit. \nBased on this notion, military spending in the war to defeat ISIS appears to have trumped the adverse effects of the U.K. decision to leave the European Union. \nThese three stocks began the year on Jim Cramer's list of 38 \"anointed\" stocks for 2016. This makes them important allocations to consider in a diversified investment portfolio. Cramer owns Lockheed in his Action Alerts PLUS portfolio.
